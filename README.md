## Murilo Ryan Barbosa da Silva

> junior web developer

Hello, my name is Murilo and
I'm a dev/student of the **python** language, and of the standard web programming suite, which includes:

> HTML - for web application semantics
>
> CSS - for website/web application body styling (html)
>
> and JavaScript - for web application dynamism

As a web programmer using python myself, I am most familiar with
with python's __Flask__ framework;
Which I use mainly for functions of organizing the files, pages and folders of the project
